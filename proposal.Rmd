Today, more and more people choose to eat outside. They think cooking at home is inconvenient and they usually have no idea of whatâ€™s to cook. Eating outside somehow means more cuisines and more choices, and that's annoying for indecisive person. So, the objective for this project is to make eating out easier by recommending people with recipes of various cuisine type. In this project, we trying to analyze recipes for different types of cuisine to predict a best-matched cuisine type based on the input ingredients, or based on what they have at home. 

The data is obtained from Kaggle, it contains over 12,000 recipes and 20 cuisine types. It contains three columns:

* id: unique recipes ID for each recipe

* cuisine: 20 different cuisine types: Brazilian, British, cajun_creole, Chinese, Filipino, French, Greek, Indian, Irish, Italian, Jamaican, Japanese, Korean, Mexican, Moroccan, Russian, Southern_us, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese

* ingredients: each recipe has its unique ingredients vector, the length varies from 1 to 110.

In an attempt to do such recommendation, we first want to perfrom exploratary data analysis, see what's the distribution for ingredients and what's the feature for each cuisine type. Then we want to perform several forms of analysis including but not limited to feature extraction (like clustering, network analysis) and multiple classification methods (like Support Vector Machine, regression, decision tree, etc).

The proposed timeline for final project:

|Nov, 15th ~ Nov, 19th | EDA                     |
|Nov, 20th ~ Nov, 25th | feature extraction      |
|Nov, 26th ~ Nov, 30th | multiple classification |
|Dec, 1st ~ Dec, 4th   | result output           |
|Dec, 5th ~ Dec, 13rd  | report writing          |
